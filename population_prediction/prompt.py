kg_info_prompt = """Let's start with some concepts of the urban knowledge graph, which captures facts related to a city. In the following, we will introduce the entities and relations in it.
The urban knowledge graph contains 7 types of entities, i.e., Brand, Point of Interest (POI), Region, Business Area, Category1(coarse-grained category), Category2(medium-grained category), Cateory3(fine-grained category). In this context, fine-grained categorys is subcategory of medium-grained category and medium-grained category is subcategory of coarse-grained category. The meaning of a specific entity is as follows.
The urban knowledge graph contains 35 types of relations to describe the connections between entities. The name of each relation consists of the entity type corresponding to the origin of this relation, the meaning of the relation, and the entity type corresponding to the destination of this relation, in order from left to right, separated by _, which indicates the relation to be experienced from the starting entity to the end entity. Below I will map the names of relations to IDs.
Mapping of relation names to IDs (The left side of the colon is the IDs and the right side is the names):
rel_1: POI_HasCategoryOf_Category1
rel_2: POI_HasCategoryOf_Category2
rel_3: POI_HasCategoryOf_Category3
